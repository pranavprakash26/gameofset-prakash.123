# gameofset-prakash.123

For some reason I couldnt commit my files to the original directory so I made my own repository and have submitted it here.

To run the game of set in the terminal:
- Download all the files and go to the directory src
- After being inside the directory src run the command ruby main.rb
- Play the game!
